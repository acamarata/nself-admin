# nself-admin Roadmap

**Purpose**: Web UI wrapper for nself CLI - provides visual interface for all nself operations
**Alignment**: nself-admin versions align with nself CLI
**Last Updated**: February 2026

---

## Vision

nself-admin is a **visual companion** to the nself CLI. It does NOT reimplement CLI logic - it provides a web interface that executes `nself` commands and displays results beautifully.

**Core Principle**: Every button click should execute an `nself` command.
