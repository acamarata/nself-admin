### Stage 4: Review & Build

Review your configuration before building:

```yaml
Summary:
  Project: my-awesome-app
  Environment: development
  Services: 9 selected
  Database: PostgreSQL 15

Estimated Build Time: 3-5 minutes
Disk Space Required: ~2GB
```

Click **"Build Project"** to start the build process.

## Step 4: Building Process

### Build Progress

You'll see real-time progress as nAdmin builds your project:

```
Building nself project...
✓ Initializing project structure
✓ Creating docker-compose.yml
✓ Setting up environment variables
↻ Pulling Docker images... (3/9)
  ✓ postgres:15-alpine
  ✓ redis:7-alpine
  ↻ hasura/graphql-engine:latest (45%)
  ⏳ minio/minio:latest
  ⏳ nginx:alpine
  ...
```

### What's Happening

1. **Project Initialization**

   ```bash
   nself init
   ```

   Creates project structure and configuration files

2. **Environment Setup**

   ```bash
   # Creates .env files with:
   - Database credentials
   - Service URLs
   - API keys
   - Secret tokens
   ```

3. **Docker Image Pull**

   ```bash
   docker pull postgres:15-alpine
   docker pull redis:7-alpine
   # ... etc
   ```

4. **Container Build**
   ```bash
   nself build
   ```
   Builds custom service containers

### Build Completion

Once complete, you'll see:

```
✅ Build completed successfully!

Summary:
- 9 services configured
- All images downloaded
- Environment ready

Click "Start Services" to continue →
```

## Step 5: Starting Services

You'll be redirected to the Start Services page.

### Start All Services

Click the **"Start All Services"** button to begin:

```
Starting services...
✓ Network created: nself_default
✓ Volume created: postgres_data
↻ Starting containers... (3/9)
  ✓ postgres: Running
  ✓ redis: Running
  ↻ hasura: Starting (health check)
  ⏳ minio: Waiting
  ...
```

### Service Health Checks

Each service goes through health checks:

1. **Container Started**: Process is running
2. **Port Available**: Service is listening
3. **Health Check**: Service is responding
4. **Ready**: Service is fully operational

### Troubleshooting Start Issues

If a service fails to start:

```
❌ hasura: Failed to start

Error: Database connection refused
Action: Check PostgreSQL is running

[Retry] [View Logs] [Skip]
```

**Common Issues:**

- Port conflicts: Change port in configuration
- Memory limits: Increase Docker resources
- Network issues: Check Docker network settings

## Step 6: Dashboard Access

Once all services are running, you'll be redirected to the main dashboard.

### Dashboard Overview

The dashboard displays:

```
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ Services        │ System Health   │
│ 9/9 Running     │ CPU: 12%        │
│                 │ Memory: 2.1GB   │
├─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│ Quick Actions   │ Recent Activity │
│ • View Logs     │ • Services      │
│ • Database      │   started       │
│ • API Docs      │ • Password set  │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

### Service Cards

Each service shows:

- **Status**: Running, Stopped, Error
- **Health**: Healthy, Unhealthy, Unknown
- **Actions**: Start, Stop, Restart, Logs
- **Metrics**: CPU, Memory usage

### Quick Access URLs

Access your services:

| Service            | URL                   | Credentials           |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Hasura Console** | http://localhost:8080 | Admin secret in env   |
| **MinIO Console**  | http://localhost:9001 | minioadmin/minioadmin |
| **PostgreSQL**     | localhost:5432        | app_user/[generated]  |
| **Redis**          | localhost:6379        | No auth (dev)         |

## Step 7: Verify Installation

### Run System Check

Navigate to `/doctor` or click "System Check":

```
System Diagnostics
==================
✅ Docker: Connected (v24.0.5)
✅ nself CLI: Found (v2.1.0)
✅ Database: Connected
✅ Services: All healthy
✅ Network: Configured
✅ Volumes: Mounted

Status: Everything is working correctly!
```

### Test Database Connection

Go to `/database` and run a test query:

```sql
SELECT version();
-- PostgreSQL 15.2 on x86_64-pc-linux-musl
```

### Check API Endpoints

Test the API at `/api/health`:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "services": {
    "postgres": "running",
    "redis": "running",
    "hasura": "running"
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-20T10:00:00Z"
}
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Configure Your Application

- Set environment variables at `/config/env`
- Configure CORS at `/config/cors`
- Set up webhooks at `/tools/webhooks`

### 2. Database Setup

- Run migrations at `/database/migrations`
- Create initial schema
- Seed development data

### 3. Development Workflow

```bash
# Monitor logs
docker logs -f <service-name>

# Access database
psql -h localhost -U app_user -d app_db

# Clear Redis cache
redis-cli FLUSHALL
```

### 4. Security Hardening

For production:

1. Change default passwords
2. Enable SSL/TLS
3. Configure firewall rules
4. Set up monitoring
5. Enable backups

## Password Reset

If you forget your admin password or need to reset it for any reason, you have two options:

### Method 1: Using nself CLI (Recommended)

The nself CLI provides a convenient command to reset the admin password:

```bash
# Reset the admin password
nself admin reset-password

# This will:
# 1. Stop the nAdmin container
# 2. Delete the password from the database
# 3. Restart the container
# 4. Prompt you to set a new password on next login
```

### Method 2: Manual Reset

You can manually reset the password by deleting the database file:

```bash
# Option A: Delete database from inside container
docker exec nself-admin rm /app/data/nadmin.db
docker restart nself-admin

# Option B: Delete database using volume
docker volume rm nself-admin-data
docker restart nself-admin

# Option C: If running locally (development)
rm ./data/nadmin.db
npm run dev
```

After resetting, navigate to http://localhost:3021 and you'll be prompted to set a new password.

### Important Notes

- **Data Loss**: Resetting the password by deleting `nadmin.db` will also clear:
  - All active sessions
  - Cached project information
  - Audit logs
  - Any other stored configuration
- **Project Data Safe**: Your actual nself project data is never affected by password reset

- **Container Must Be Running**: For the CLI reset command to work, the nAdmin container must be running

## Common First-Time Issues

### Issue: Can't Access Dashboard

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check if container is running
docker ps | grep nself-admin

# Check logs
docker logs nself-admin

# Restart if needed
docker restart nself-admin
```

### Issue: Services Won't Start

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check Docker resources
docker system df
docker system prune -a

# Increase Docker memory
# Docker Desktop > Settings > Resources
```

### Issue: Database Connection Failed

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check PostgreSQL is running
docker ps | grep postgres

# Test connection
docker exec -it postgres psql -U app_user

# Check credentials in .env
cat .env | grep DATABASE_URL
```

### Issue: Port Already in Use

**Solution:**

```bash
# Find what's using the port
lsof -i :3021

# Use different port
PORT=3022 nself admin
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Small**: Begin with essential services only
2. **Use Development Mode**: Easier passwords and relaxed security
3. **Monitor Resources**: Keep Docker Desktop open to watch resource usage
4. **Read Logs**: Most issues are explained in service logs
5. **Take Snapshots**: Backup your database after initial setup
